            </div>Leafcutter ants, unlike most other ant species, clear their
            trails. By removing all undergrowth and by even flattening the
            ground, they greatly increase their speed of movement and overall
            resource transport. With networks reaching kilometers in length,
            leaf cutter ants produce one of the most complex infrastructure in
            the animal world.<br>
	    Yet some trails remain uncleared. Clearly, there is a decision
	    being made whether or not a trail should
	    be cleared.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    For my PhD project, I investigate the self-organisation dynamics behind
	    making this decision, and the mechanism of the actual removal of
	    undergrowth and debris from the trails.
            <br>
            <br>
            My tool set to address these questions encompasses self-written image processing methods,
            statistical analysis and mathematical modeling.<br>

            <h3>Collective Nest construction and chain formation in the
            weaver ant <i>Oecophylla smaragdina</i></h3><br>

            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-6">
                <a href=""><img height="100%" src="img/oecophylla-2.jpg" width=
                "100%"></a>
            </div>Weaver ants are an arboreal ant species, living inside
            conspicuous nests made up from living leaves. Construction of these
            nests requires the coordinated effort of a large workforce: first,
            leaves are communally bent and folded into position, before workers
            carrying larvae arrive. These larvae produce silk, and, as the
            workers move the larvae like weaver's shuttles between the leaves,
            a growing white silk sheet joins the new nest together.<br>
            <br>
            Nest construction in social insects is a classical example for
            collective behaviour. Without a blueprint, knowledge of the entire
            environment, or communication with the rest of the builders, ants
            frequently construct nests millions of times their own size. How do
            individual workers with a very limited sensory and physical
            capacity know which task to perform, and where?<br>
            <br>
            Surprisingly, collected colonies will use artificial materials like
            paper or a thin plastic sheet to construct a nest. In the lab, I
            offered colonies leaves of different properties and observed the
            nest construction. Focus of my interest was how weaver ants
            collectively make a decision for a new nest site, and how they
            manage the feat of rolling up leaves much too sturdy for any
            individual: as in a tug-of-war, workers form into long organised
            pulling chains, thereby mustering the necessary force to bend
            leaves into the desired assembly.<br>
            <br>
            From these experiments, I find that both shape and choice of
            material influence the selection of a suitable leaf. Sturdy leaves
            are ignored; on flexible leaves, workers are attracted to prominent
            tips. There, pulling chains form more frequently, persist longer,
            and achiever greater success in rolling up the leaves.<br>
            <br>
