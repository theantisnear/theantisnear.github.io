	    Surprisingly, collected colonies will use artificial materials like paper or a thin plastic sheet to construct a nest. In the lab, I offered colonies leaves of different properties and observed the nest construction. Focus of my interest was how weaver ants collectively make a decision for a new nest site, and how they manage the feat of rolling up leaves much too sturdy for any individual: as in a tug-of-war, workers form into long organised pulling chains, thereby mustering the necessary force to bend leaves into the desired assembly. 
	<p>
	  From these experiments, I find that both shape and choice of material influence the selection of a suitable leaf. Sturdy leaves are ignored; on flexible leaves, workers are attracted to prominent tips. There, pulling chains form more frequently, persist longer, and achiever greater success in rolling up the leaves.

	  Weaver ants are an arboreal ant species, living inside conspicuous nests made up from living leaves. Construction of these nests requires the coordinate effort of a large workforce: first, leaves are communally bent and folded into position, before workers carrying larvae arrive. These larvae produce silk, and, as the workers move the larvae like weaver's shuttles between the leaves, a growing white silk sheet joins the new nest together.
	<p>
	  Nest construction in social insects is a classical example for collective behaviour. Without a blueprint, knowledge of the entire environment, or communication with the rest of the builders, ants frequently construct nests millions of times their own size. How do individual workers with a very limited sensory and physical capacity know which task to perform, and where?
